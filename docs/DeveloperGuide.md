## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of
each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in
the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-1/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML
Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit
diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes
called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It
is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and
exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`
, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are
in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying
   help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for a typical Command.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component](images/CommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `CommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**
API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that
  the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
* stores a `PersonStreakList` for use in the Streaks dashboard. The additional class diagram can be found [here](#streaks-dashboard).

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**
API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Theme

The implementation of theme is done by parsing the raw values of the `json` file containing a color palette, and then
transforming them into a `css` file that is then applied to `MainWindow.fxml`. All other elements will read from the
same `css` file. When the application is first launched, it will apply the default theme constructed by `ThemeFactory`.
When a theme is set by the command, it and it's temporary `css` file will be stored as variables in `ThemeManager`,
which will subsequently be used by the other parts of the application (for e.g. messageboxes).

#### Initialization

When the application starts up, it first checks for any previously used themes in `UserPrefs`. If not found, the
application continues to use the default theme. Otherwise, it attempts to load the theme file with
`ThemeFactory#load()`.

![Sequence diagram for `ThemeManager` initialization](images/ThemeInitializationSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Command Invocation

When the command `theme` is invoked, the following happens:

1. A `Theme t` instance is created by calling `ThemeManager#load(FILE)`, where `FILE` is the supplied file path.
2. `ThemeManager#setTheme(t, FILE)` is then called. This stores/generates the following:
    * `theme` - The `Theme` object currently used.
    * `themePath` - The path of the `json` file.
    * `cssCacheUri` - The temp file containing the `CSS` to be used by `MainWindow.fxml`'s `scene`.
3. When the command gets executed, the result is processed by `MainWindow#executeCommand()`. The flag `theme` will be
   set, informing the application that there is a change in `cssCacheUri` and it applies the theme.

The following sequence diagram depicts the simplified workings of the command:
![Sequence diagram for theme invocation](images/ThemeCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Termination

When the program terminates, `themePath` is saved into `UserPrefs` so it can locate the same theme for subsequent runs.

### Details panel tab switching

The `DetailsPanel` is used for displaying multiple types of content. We will refer to each type of content as a tab. By
default, it displays a list of upcoming dates, but it can be toggled to display other tabs as well.

#### Implementation

Each tab should have its own respective UI component and an instance of the component should be stored in `DetailsPanel`
. All tabs should also be recorded as enums
under [`DetailsPanelTab`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/core/DetailsPanelTab.java)
. Toggling to a new tab is done via the execution of commands.

1. The user will first enter a command text which requests for the tab to be switched.
2. The command text will be parsed by `InputParser` and the respective command will be created.
3. The command will be executed by `LogicManager`, and a `CommandResult` containing information of the new tab to toggle
   to will be created.
4. When `MainWindow` receives the `CommandResult`, it will check if there is a new tab to toggle to.
5. If so, `MainWindow` will execute `DetailsPanel#toggleTab()` and `DetailsPanel` will update its display accordingly.

The sequence diagram below depicts the execution path when the user enters a command which requests for the tab to be
switched.

![SwitchTabSequenceDiagram](images/SwitchTabSequenceDiagram.png)

### Streaks dashboard

The Streaks Dashboard shows the streaks maintained with each contact sorted in descending order. Refer to the UG Streaks section for more information.
Each streak has to be calculated based on the recorded meetings of each person and today's date. This operation is costly and so we want to avoid recomputing this value
as much as possible. Since streaks can be computed from the attributes of a person, they are not stored in the data file. The classes that are used to display the Streaks Dashboard
is shown below.

![StreaksDashboardClassDiagram](images/StreaksDashboardClassDiagram.png)

#### Initialization

This section will detail the steps the program takes to calculate streaks of everyone when it is started. 

1. `AddressBook` receives a copy of the deserialized `AddressBook` data. It calls `setPersons` of `PersonStreaklist` with the persons found in the data.
2. `PersonStreakList` will process this data and create a `PersonStreak` from each `Person`. A `PersonStreak` will bind a `Person` and his/her `Streak` together in a single class. 
3. This is done by calling `PersonStreak#fromPerson()` which will use the `Streak#from()` to calculate the Streak from a Person.
4. Once all the `PersonStreak` are created, they will be sent back to the `PersonStreakList` and put into an internal observable list, named `internalLst`. 

`internalLst` will contain all the `PersonStreak` objects that will be used to display the dashboard. It will be enclosed by a filtered list to show only `PersonStreak` that have an active goal set. 
An active goal is any valid goal that is not `NONE`, refer to UG `set-goal` for more information. The filtered list will then be made unmodifiable before being exposed to UI components to consume.

The sequence diagram below depicts the execution path when the program is initialized.

![InitStreaksDashboardSequenceDiagram](images/InitStreaksDashboardSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Updating a person

This section will detail how a `PersonStreak` is updated when the `Person` in it is modified.

1. When the `AddressBook#setPerson()` is run, `PersonStreakList#setPerson()` will also be executed. This is the entry point to updating a `Person` in the `PersonStreakList`.
2. Internally, the `PersonStreakList` will remove the original `Person` and add the edited `Person` into the internal observable list, named `internalList`. 
3. The `PersonStreakList` will calculate the streak of the added person and insert it correctly into `internalList`.
4. Once the `internalList` is updated, any UI components listening to it through the API exposed by `PersonStreakList` will be updated automatically.

The sequence diagram below depicts the execution path when a person is updated.

![UpdateStreaksDashboardSequenceDiagram](images/UpdateStreaksDashboardSequenceDiagram.png)

### Add Group

The sequence diagram below depicts the execution path when a `AddGroupCommand` is executed.

![AddGroupSequenceDiagram](images/AddGroupSequenceDiagram.png)

### Add Picture

FriendDex allows users to add a picture to their contact. This section details the implementation of that feature.

#### Implementation

1. The user will first supply the index of the contact to edit and the path to an image file.
2. `AddPictureCommand` will take the file path and validate it.
3. If everything looks good, the image file will be renamed to a random UUID and copied to `[JAR file location]/data`.
   The renaming is done to avoid problems with two image files having the same file name.
4. A `Picture` object will then be created, storing the file path of the copied image file.
5. Lastly, it will be attached to the `Person` being edited and saved to `Model`.

The sequence diagram below depicts the execution path when a `AddPictureCommand` is executed.
